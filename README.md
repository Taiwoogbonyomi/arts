# **Art Connect**
Art Connect is an interactive art blogging platform that allows users to share their artwork, engage with posts through likes and comments, and explore different categories. The inspiration for creating this blog came from my spouse, who is an artist and has always wanted a space to showcase his work and connect with other creatives. 
While this website could have real-world applications, it was specifically developed as part of Portfolio Project 5 (Advanced Front End) for the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development with Code Institute.
 Although itâ€™s not a fully realized blog, the process has given me valuable insights into what I can build for my spouse in the future.
